This is the Linux version of Don Higgin's Z390 emulator. All the *.BAT files were modified to work in Linux environment.  They do not need to be chmod +x as they are called from z390.jar.  There is more to be done to make everything user frienly and functional. All the Assembler menu items have been tested on Fedora 19,also COBOL menu items were added in. I hope to add menu functions for other capabilities soon.

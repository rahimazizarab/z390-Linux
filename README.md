This is the source version of Don Higgin's Z390 emulator. Tools menu was added for online programming functions.  There is more to be done to make everything user frienly and functional. All the Assembler menu items have been tested on Fedora 19,also COBOL menu items were added in. I hope to add menu functions for other capabilities soon.
